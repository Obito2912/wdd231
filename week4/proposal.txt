Project Subject:
I'm not very good at thinking of a whole new project in such a short time.
I think I will create an website about anime. Nothing crazy but so far that's what
I got. Maybe I will change it later. 

Project Description:
I saw that there are a lot of free anime APIs where I can retrieve information
from so I will create like a blog with the later news about the best anime shows
in these last few months. 

Project Reason and Purpose:
The reason is just because I want to practice more working with APIs and I really
enjoy watching anime. There are many people who also enjoy anime so this website
will serve the purpose of getting the latest news about the anime they are following.
